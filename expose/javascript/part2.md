4. discountPrices returns an array of final prices after applying the discount. This is becasue discoutPrices loops through the given
    prices array and pushes a discounted price to the returned array according to discount. 
   
5. ReferenceError: i is not defined; let only allows for block scope, so it is no longer defined when execution reaches line 12;

13. A. '32'; The first input is a string, so the operation is treated as concatenation. 
    B. 1; Because there no string operation using '-', '3' is casted to a 3 to perform subtraction. 
    C. 3; null is treated as 0, so 3 + null = 3 + 0 = 3
    D. '3null'; The first input is a string, so the operation is treated as concatenation. 
    E. 4; True has the integer value 1, so addition is performed. 1 + 3 = 4. 
    F. 0; False has the value 0 and null is treated as 0. Therfore the addtion 0 + 0 yields 0. 
    G. '3undefined'; The first input is a string, so the operation is treated as concatenation. 
    H. NaN; Because there no string operation using '-', '3' is casted to a 3 to perform subtraction, yielding undefined. 

14. A. true; string '2' becomes a number 2.
    B. false; string '2' becomes 2 and string '12' becomes 12. 
    C. true; string '2' becomes 2. 
    D. false; the types are not the same, so false. 
    E. false; true has the value 1, so false.  
    F. true; Boolean(2) returns true, a boolean, so the types are the same. 

15. '==' allows for type coersion while '===' does not. For example 1 == true is true but 1 === true is false due to the types. 
    
17.  [2, 4, 6]; modifyArray loops through every element of array and pushes the doSomething each element to the returned array. 
                doSomething simply multiples a number by two, so every element in the array is multiplied by two.
